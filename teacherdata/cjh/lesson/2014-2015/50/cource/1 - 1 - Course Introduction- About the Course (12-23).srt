[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,178
Ok, hello everyone welcome to the
Programming Languages class.

3
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:13,780
I 'm Dan Grossman and I'm looking forward
to having a great class with all of you.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,700
And what i want to do is sort of natural,
and this sort of first lecture is

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,310
just give you an overview of what the
class is going to sort of be like.

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,570
And get you excited about what we're
going to do.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,770
And basically over the next 10 weeks, I
hope that

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,760
we will, together, learn the fundamental
concepts underneath programming languages.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,450
So, I don't intend for this to be an easy
course.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,170
But I think it's something that with hard
work, and patience,

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,500
and coming in with an open mind ready to
learn new things.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,410
it has the opportunity to make everyone a

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,990
better programmer than they came in before
the course.

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,580
And in fact I think it will make you a

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,400
better programmer in programming languages
we're not going to study at all.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,180
And even in programming languages you
already know.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,850
So the idea is that we're going to learn

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,870
the concepts that come up in any
programming language.

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,920
And get better at recognizing them

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,520
despite the surface level differences
between languages.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,220
So what tends to happen all the time when
people look at a course like this.

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,350
Is they say, oh, that's the course that
teaches ML, Racket, and Ruby.

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,510
Which are the three programming languages
we're going to use.

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,260
But I really don't like that description
of the course.

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,250
because the idea is that we're just going
to use those languages

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,810
as vehicles to learn the concepts that
come up in any programming language.

27
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,350
In any case, this video is not going to
cover programming languages at all.

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,060
It's going to be more of the course
mechanics, that sort of stuff.

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,770
Then the next one I'll do a little more of
course introduction

30
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,300
that's programming-language specific and
then we'll

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,790
get going into the course content.

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,080
Here's a real simple list of things you
can do right now,

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,710
even before you get started on the first
homework and things like that.

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,850
the obvious thing to do is get familiar
with the course website.

35
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,020
How the different pieces are laid out.

36
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,740
if you have taken a Coursera course
before, I think it'll be fairly familiar.

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,840
But we all do things a little bit
differently.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,780
And if not, I don't think you'll have too
much trouble.

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,860
But take a few minutes.
Look at the different sections.

40
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,750
Get started on the discussion board, that
sort of thing.

41
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,240
Second, I hope you'll complete the
beginning

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,460
of course survey, I think that'll be fun,

43
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,740
so that we can all find out more about the
community that we're all participating in.

44
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,830
And it shouldn't take you any time.

45
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,010
And third, and this is probably the most
time-consuming and important,

46
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,260
get the software installed that you need
for the first homework.

47
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,890
We're going to be using an editor and a
programming language and

48
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,710
a couple of tools that you may not be
familiar with.

49
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,820
And it's a bit of a pain to get it all
installed.

50
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,680
We've provided step by step instructions
that you can just read through.

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,060
We've also provided some videos of me
literally installing the same software

52
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,360
on Windows which may be helpful.

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,280
And this is just stuff that you may was
well do now.

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,880
That is you wait until you're ready to
start the homework.

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,390
You'll just find it more aggravating.

56
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,700
So it's a good thing to do early maybe
after even just

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,329
watching this first video or the second
one or something like that.

58
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,550
give you a brief overview of the sort of
materials

59
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,130
that'll be available to you as you go
through the course.

60
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,700
Obviously there will be lectures like
this.

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,610
I also have written reading notes covering
all the same material.

62
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,830
So you don't need to read these because
they'll by

63
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,910
and large cover the same material that we
cover here interactively.

64
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,070
With slides and writing code and with me
talking.

65
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,880
but they can be really helpful if you want
a more

66
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,030
precise explanation, or you just like to
read a few sentences to

67
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,920
get exactly the point I'm trying to make.

68
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,860
And so I really encourage you to read
those, and

69
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,620
will always post those together with the
other lecture materials.

70
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,940
any code that I, show or write, or we go
through in one of

71
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,710
the lectures, I'll post separately so that
you can actually have the text file.

72
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,750
Rather than having to retype it or paste
it out of a PowerPoint slide.

73
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,410
I will have homework assignments.

74
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,070
Those homework assignments are going to
get graded both by scripts

75
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,590
we've written.

76
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,550
That are going to read through and, you
know, run them

77
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,160
against tests and give you points and that
sort of thing.

78
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,010
And we're also going to use some very
simple pure assessment.

79
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,150
Meaning that you are going to have your
assignment graded by a few

80
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,120
other students in the class, and you are
going to grade a few.

81
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,520
This is going to be very simple.

82
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,530
It's going to be something like a rate on
a one through five sort of thing.

83
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,560
And this helps me emphasize that it's not
enough to just pass the test.

84
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,720
What we're trying to do is learn how to
write software

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,190
in clean, elegant, beautiful ways.

86
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,450
And that's something that humans can
evaluate much better than computers.

87
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,230
Also have a couple exams.

88
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,670
one about halfway through, and one at the
end.

89
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,010
And that's because there's a number of
concepts in this course

90
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,750
that I want you guys to learn and answer
questions about.

91
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,190
that you can't really demonstrate your
knowledge of by just writing programs.

92
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,680
So most of the homework will pretty much

93
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,800
be all programming, and then the exams
will

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,720
ask some more other conceptual questions.

95
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,860
in terms of the homework, we'll probably
have seven, so

96
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,270
there won't be one for every week of the
course.

97
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,850
And I'll keep you apprised of how that is
working out.

98
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,310
You should do them individually although
of course you'll get help

99
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,260
on the discussion board and from fellow
students as you need.

100
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,430
And the thing I always like to emphasize
is, is if

101
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,477
you want to do them efficiently and learn
the most from them.

102
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:59,990
the counter productive way to do it

103
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,250
is just try to get the right answer and
crank out

104
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,790
the code as quickly as you can and turn it
in.

105
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,810
usually, you'll actually find it takes
less time.

106
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,880
If, when you approach a homework question.

107
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,940
You look at hey, what concept is this
question

108
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,630
related to that we went through in the
lectures?

109
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,560
Then write the code that pretty much has
it working.

110
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,300
And then to make sure you got it, test
your code.

111
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,120
And, even try some variations.
Say well, I think this

112
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,350
is right, but if I change this around a
little bit,

113
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,270
I'd bet it's wrong, and here's the test
it's going to fail.

114
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,390
And I think if you do that, you'll get a
lot more out of

115
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,680
the homework, and you'll be much more

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,820
confident that you have the right
solutions.

117
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,000
Just this one more logistically or
structural things, sometimes on

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,100
the homework, I'll have what I call
challenge problems those

119
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,590
are just somewhat more difficult problems
that those of you

120
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,710
who find the course a little bit easier
might enjoy doing.

121
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,610
And that you can learn a lot more from.

122
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,760
But for the rest of you, you don't have to
do them.

123
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,150
We'll make them worth just a small number
of points so that

124
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,280
people who do them feel they get something
tangible out of it.

125
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,030
but you are welcome to skip them, so you
can think of them as optional.

126
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,870
Last sort of thing about the homeworks.

127
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,250
I've sort of learned from experience, that
students are sometimes

128
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:16,350
surprised at how precisely and concisely
my homework questions are worded.

129
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,300
I think that's because I'm a computer
scientist, and

130
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,880
I tend to write English the way I write
code.

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,570
Which is I put exactly what needs to

132
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,750
be there and make sure it's defined very
precisely.

133
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,340
And I think for technical questions like a
homework problem that's the great

134
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,900
way to do it.

135
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,070
but what this means is that if you're use
to sort of standard internet

136
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,860
work where you just skim things and try to
get the high level idea.

137
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,780
You might find them very frustrating.

138
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,835
So I encourage you when you get into
especially the first homework assignment.

139
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:47,320
I've really try to trust that each word
and

140
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,360
phrase there and each question is there
for a reason.

141
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,395
Read it all the way through.

142
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:53,500
I've try to keep them as short as
possible.

143
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,630
Just a couple of pages

144
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,170
long usually.

145
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,860
and I think you'll find them a lot easier
to

146
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,350
approach if you take a sort of no skimming
allowed view.

147
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,530
Now that doesn't mean that the homework
will always be crystal-clear to you.

148
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,890
So, if you are confused, that's what the
discussion board is for.

149
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,220
I may have even made a mistake, although I
certainly don't intend to.

150
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,970
And, what typically happens, is you think
a

151
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,090
homework question is very confusing in how
it's worded.

152
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,730
But then after you do it, if you go

153
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,780
back and read the question again.

154
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,510
you'll see, oh that's not confusing at all
maybe I was the one that was confused.

155
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,380
and that's how you learn the material, and
I'm

156
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,030
looking forward to exploring that process
with all of you.

157
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,340
a few other things that we'll do in the
class

158
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,880
I'll try to put on the web page everything
you need.

159
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,230
But when your're learning new programming
languages, learning new

160
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,200
ideas, you sometimes have to look up
details elsewhere.

161
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,420
I won't do that on purpose.

162
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,940
But you also

163
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,470
shouldn't be surprised if you find
yourself looking up some

164
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,690
language feature that's not covered in the
lecture or something.

165
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,000
I, and occasionally I'll have some
optional material, some offshoots where

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,340
I'll say here's a little video that if
know say C programming.

167
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,950
you might appreciate this connection with
something you already know.

168
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,830
there's a small group of TAs that are
mostly

169
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,990
behind the scenes, but we'll see how the
course goes.

170
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,960
And maybe they'll do some, video question
answering or something so that they can

171
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,640
have some of the fun tool.

172
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,360
And the bottom line is I just hope this is
a great adventure for all of us.

173
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,330
you know I hope to really create an
active, energetic community.

174
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,660
I hope to share with you My passion and my
excitement for programming

175
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,440
languages is my favorite class in the
world, which is maybe not too surprising.

176
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,820
That that's the one I chose to create for
this Coursera environment.

177
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,530
And I actually have a now not so secret
goal, which is.

178
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,830
It's well known for these classes that
only a small percentage of students

179
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,650
who start the course stick with it all the
way through and finish it.

180
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,330
And, and I hope we set records for that.

181
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,250
I'm not going to make the class easy.

182
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,010
I hope it's challenging because that's
what

183
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,040
I think will actually keep you engaged.

184
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,160
But I would really love for people to look
at this community we're creating ten

185
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,450
weeks from now and say, wow, that was,
that was one of the best ones.

186
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,620
How did they do it I, I, I hope more
courses are like

187
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,800
that and let's see if we can work together
to make that happen.

188
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:04,730
Okay.

189
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,560
So at this point you are welcome to stop
watching this video.

190
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,870
I've covered what I need to cover for the
course.

191
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,410
But I thought if your going to spend all
these

192
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,460
hours over the next couple months
listening to me.

193
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,310
you might like to know a little bit more
about me.

194
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,640
Just like I would be very curious to learn
a little bit more about you.

195
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,270
At least from filling out the online

196
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,420
survey so I can get some aggregate
information.

197
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,630
So this is just for fun

198
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,370
if your curious.

199
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,420
This is my country, this is the United
States, I grew up

200
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,870
right in the middle of it until I was 18
years old.

201
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,450
I lived in the suburbs of St. Louis,
Missouri.

202
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,320
After that, I went off to college in
Houston, Texas.

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
I loved going to Rice University.

204
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,300
I really miss the burritos, that's
probably

205
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,420
my favorite thing about living in Texas.

206
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,910
After that I went and got a PhD at Cornell
University in Ithica, New York.

207
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,020
It's a small town.

208
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,570
If you're not familiar with New York
State,

209
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,840
that's a 4 and a half hour drive from New
York City.

210
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,980
So it's actually a small town.

211
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,150
quite a distance from the larger cities.

212
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,910
And then in 2003, I moved to Seattle.

213
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,570
Which is the, my favorite place that I've
ever lived in.

214
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,450
And I've been a faculty member at the
University of Washington since then.

215
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,740
A little bit about my research and
teaching and what

216
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,330
I do, I do consider myself a programming
languages person.

217
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,380
But a bit of an applied one, or a little
bit of a strange one.

218
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,640
Where what

219
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,020
I like to do is take the fundamental
beauty of programming languages.

220
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,540
Things like the functional languages and
type systems

221
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,850
that we're actually going to study in this
course.

222
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,520
And instead of necessarily working to make
them better, I try

223
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,200
to take the ideas behind them and apply
them to other areas.

224
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,380
Areas where you might not expect them to
be as applicable.

225
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,760
So I have worked a lot over the last

226
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,290
few years in trying to make multi-threaded
programming.uh, easier.

227
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,910
So that it's, you can more effectively and
efficiently program,

228
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,040
the multicore chips that are becoming
ubiquitus in the computing industry.

229
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,460
I'm now working a bit on how you can
better write software that' s more

230
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,870
energy efficient so batteries last longer
and

231
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,620
you spend less money on your power bill.

232
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,840
I've worked on other things a bit, like
web programming

233
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,090
or, dealing with programs that process
massive amounts of data.

234
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,300
And this

235
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,210
is really just like the, the way I like to
operate.

236
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,170
That I like to collaborate with others
that maybe

237
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,740
don't have as much of a programming
languages background.

238
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,610
And then I learn from them some of the
real world needs that they have.

239
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,980
And, and somehow we, we combine to, to
make

240
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,149
progress and, and to make computing and
software better.

241
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
outside of that, I don't spend all my

242
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,990
time sitting inside recording videos and
doing research.

243
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,370
I love to go hiking, this is a picture of
me from

244
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,190
up in Montana last summer.

245
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,100
About once a week, I go and play ice
hockey.

246
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,860
You can't tell this is me at all, but that
actually

247
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,380
is me under the gear there in the front of
the picture.

248
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,770
I love riding my bike, this is me
finishing up a 200 mile

249
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,910
or 320 kilometer bike ride from Seattle to
Portland, a couple summers ago.

250
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,120
And if that's not enough sort of cute, fun
pictures.

251
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,640
this is the dog I live with, and her name
is Red Dog and she's amazingly awesome.

252
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,610
Okay I also like to travel.

253
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,150
Here's a list of countries I visited,
ranked in order from smallest to largest.

254
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,190
So I'll be curious to see if we have
students

255
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,390
in class from most or possibly even all of
these countries.

256
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,160
I also traveled all over the United
States.

257
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,880
I am missing three states, I'm still

258
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,270
hoping to get to Alaska Delaware and
Hawaii.

259
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,570
So, welcome.
That's a little bit about me.

260
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,620
Remember to tell me a little bit about
you.

261
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,310
And in the next video, we'll get started
on programming languages.
